# JavaScript ES6 and beyond: Discover all the new features introduced to JavaScript from 2015 to 2018

![book-cover](.gitbook/assets/cover.png)

## Disclaimer

This book is intended for somebody already familiar with the basics of JavaScript, as I am only focusing on the new features introduced by ES6 and I won't be explaining what is a `var`, how to create a function, etc...

Additional chapters cover the new features introduced post ES6 (ES2015) all the way to the most recent version, ES2018.

## About me

My name is Alberto, I'm from Italy and I love programming. As I was studying ES6 I decided that the best way for me to test my understanding of it was to write articles about it. I have now packaged those articles in a free ebook that you can read here or on my blog [here](http://albertomontalesi.github.io/).
