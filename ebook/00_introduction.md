# Introduction

This book is the sum of all of my studies on JavaScript throughout the past few months.

As as self-taught web developer I've been reading books, watching tutorials, and reading articles to keep myself up-to-date on the newest version of JavaScript. While doing so, I took several notes.

I have now compiled all these notes in a concise book, covering almost all of the new features that have been added to the language between 2015 and 2018.

Writing this book has been a long journey, but the end result makes me really proud of having started writing it.

As a self-taught developer I know the importance of sharing knowledge and material, and that is why this book can be read online on my [website](https://www.inspiredwebdev.com/courses/the-complete-guide-to-modern-javascript/) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/AlbertoMontalesi/JavaScript-es6-and-beyond-ebook), where more than 170 people already showed their appreciation for it.

**Disclaimer**

This book is intended for people already familiar with the basics of JavaScript, as I am only focusing on the new features introduced by ES6 and I won't be explaining what `var` is, how to create functions, etc...

Additional chapters cover the new features introduced post-ES6 (ES2015) all the way to the most recent version, ES2018.
