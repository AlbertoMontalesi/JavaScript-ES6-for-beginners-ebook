# Introduction

This book is the sum of all my study on JavaScript throughout the past few months.
As as self-taught web developer I read books, watched tutorials and read articles to keep myself updated to the newest version of JavaScript and while doing so I took several notes.

I have now compiled all these notes in a concise book, covering almost all the new features that have been added to JavaScript since 2015 until 2018.

Writing this book has been a long journey but the end result makes me really proud of having started writing it.

As a self-taught developer I know the importance of sharing knowledge and materials and that is why this book can be read online on my [website](https://www.inspiredwebdev.com/courses/the-complete-guide-to-modern-javascript/) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/AlbertoMontalesi/JavaScript-es6-and-beyond-ebook) where more than 170 people already showed their appreciation for it.

**Disclaimer**

This book is intended for somebody already familiar with the basics of JavaScript, as I am only focusing on the new features introduced by ES6 and I won't be explaining what is a `var`, how to create a function, etc...

Additional chapters cover the new features introduced post ES6 (ES2015) all the way to the most recent version, ES2018.
